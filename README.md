# Next.js Course: Page Pre-Rendering & Data Fetching

This repository contains the code and practice materials for **Section 13: Page Pre-Rendering & Data Fetching** from the comprehensive Next.js course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

## Course Information

- **Course Name:** Learn NextJS from the ground up and build fullstack ReactJS + NextJS apps with the App Router or Pages Router!
- **Instructor:** Maximilian Schwarzmüller
- **Section:** Sección 13: Page Pre-Rendering & Data Fetching

## About this Section

This section of the course focuses on one of the most powerful features of Next.js: its rendering strategies and data fetching capabilities. You will explore concepts such as:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-rendering pages at build time.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Pre-rendering pages on each request.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Updating static pages after building.
- **Client-Side Data Fetching:** Fetching data on the client side when pre-rendering isn't necessary or optimal.
- Using functions like `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, and `getServerSideProps` (if using the Pages Router) or the newer data fetching paradigms in the App Router.
